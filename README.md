- **Story:** Authenticate (keep track of moods, etc.), check userâ€™s current accounts (Netflix/HBO/etc.), question card for mood for how the user feels and stores it, categories (movie/show/etc), leveraging libraries to get the different genres/moods, providing user with options based on parsed genres
- **Market:** Everyone
- **Habit:** Mental check-in provides user with value that will keep them coming back (maybe using visual displays) / natural habitual users
