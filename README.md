### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment/mental check-in
- **Mobile:** Suggests media(playlists, movies, tv shows, podcasts, etc) for different mental states
- **Story:** Authenticate (keep track of moods, etc.), check userâ€™s current accounts (Netflix/HBO/etc.), question card for mood for how the user feels and stores it, categories (movie/show/etc), leveraging libraries to get the different genres/moods, providing user with options based on parsed genres
- **Market:** Everyone
- **Habit:** Mental check-in provides user with value that will keep them coming back (maybe using visual displays) / natural habitual users
- **Scope:** Started off as mental wellness but can expand to entertainment, and social networking for users by keeping track of moods in some sort of diary or a social aspect to see what friends are watching.
